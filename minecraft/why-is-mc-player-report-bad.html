  <h2>Minecraft's Player Report System</h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/what-minecraft">Minecraft</a> has added a player reporting system into base Minecraft. 
    It bans players off of Minecraft (Including <a herf="https://gamerant.com/minecraft-game-modes-facts-guide/">Single Player</a>) when you say somthing even minorly (affencive like "dumb")
  It can be good because a player reporting system built into the game might be good.</p>
